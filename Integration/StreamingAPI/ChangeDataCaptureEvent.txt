Change Data Capture Event (CDC Event)

Different of the other streaming channels, for this one, you don't need specify the fields you want to push the notifications.
When a CRUD happens, automatically all fields are notified, no matters where was the change.

To apply it:
    Setup > Change Data Capture

    Select the available objects and move it to selected side.


The subscription for the consumers are something like that:

Change Data Capture Event: 
    /data/<customObject__ChangeEvent>
    /data/Treinamento__ChangeEvent
    /data/<StandardObjectChangeEvent>
    /data/AccountChangeEvent

Push Topic Notification: /topic/<PushTopic>
