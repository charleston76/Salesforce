From setup > Integration > API menu, you can generate different WSDL files to integrate organizations or other consumers through the WSDL file.
To do that you just create it from the options under "WSDL and Client Certificates" section:

Enterprise WSDL
    A strongly typed WSDL for customers who want to build an integration with their Salesforce organization only.
    Sample file: EnterpriseWSDL.xml

Partner WSDL
    A loosely typed WSDL for customers, partners, and ISVs who are building client applications for multiple organizations. It can be used to access data within any organization.
    Sample file: PartnerWSDL.xml

There are other types you can check from this GUI, but now, we'll comment only about the two ones above.

Generate WSDL for an apex class:

Setup > Apex Classes, click in the class do you want create (SOAP_IntegrationAccount) and clicks on "Generate WSDL"
    Sample file: SOAP_IntegrationAccount.xml

In the other organization, you can create a consumer based in this wsdl file:
    Setup > Apex Classes > Generate from WSDL
And it will create 4 apex classes.
But if appears the error message "Apex Generation File - Unsuported schema type... anyType", you need open the WSDL origin file, find the word "anyType" and replace with the actual type.
From the created classess you'll need extract the endpoints, and save those as "Remote site settings".
